# KR2
## Overview
KR2 leverages the Kinisi Robotics "gym_kr2-PickYCB-v1_generated" dataset to provide resources and code for research, prototyping, and experimentation in robotics, machine learning, and manipulation tasks using real-world object data. The project is developed in Jupyter Notebook format, making it suitable for educational use, reproducible research, and rapid prototyping.

## Features
- Interfaces with the Kinisi Robotics PickYCB dataset
- Example Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and manipulation tasks
- Extensible framework for robotics simulation and analysis
- Designed for reproducibility and easy collaboration
